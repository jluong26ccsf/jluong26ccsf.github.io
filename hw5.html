        <p><span class="letter">T</span>here was some confusion when I wanted to change the opacity of the background image, but I finally got it working properly. For a long time, <br>
            I couldn't correct the opacity of the text. When I changed the opacity of the body element, I forgot that it would affect the entire body element<br>
            so I searched on Google and learned how to solve my problem.</p>
        <p><span class="letter">A</span>lthough I got the background image to work, the some of the text does not fit inside the image. They stick out of the background image.</p>

            <p><span class="foot">As we are reaching the end of this page, I will share my experiences while doing this assignment.</span></p>
            <p>I learned to use the span tag to specify certain characters to change in appearance.</p>
            <p>For the background image, I learned to change the opacity without it affecting the text of the website. What I learned was to create a pseudo element for the body. </p>
            <p>Overall, the assignment was pretty fun to do.</p>
